# PAW: Puppies at Work


## Up-and-running

Development is made easier through the use of [Docker]().  

```
docker build -t hydrant .
```


## Deployment and Devices

We used the following hardware internally, but in reality, you can use any device that supports bluetoothe and can run a Docker container. 

- Raspberri Pi 2, Model B
- Pluggable USB Bluetooth Adapter 
- A mixture of BTLE devices (this is fairly device agnostic) as the "Kibbles"
